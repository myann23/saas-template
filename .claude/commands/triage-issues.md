# Triage Open Issues

Review and organize open GitHub issues for this repo.

## Process
1. List all open issues: `gh issue list --state open --limit 50`
2. For each issue, assess:
   - Is it well-defined? (clear acceptance criteria)
   - What's the priority? (critical, high, medium, low)
   - What milestone? (MVP, v2, Backlog)
3. Add missing labels where needed
4. Suggest which issues to tackle next based on:
   - Dependencies (what unblocks other work)
   - Impact (user value)
   - Effort (quick wins vs. big lifts)

## Output
Provide a prioritized list of recommended next issues to work on.
