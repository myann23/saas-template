# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with this project.

## Project Overview
[Fill in: What is this project? What problem does it solve?]

## Tech Stack
[Fill in: What technologies are you using?]

**Framework recommendation:** Use Next.js (App Router) for any web app with public-facing pages. Next.js provides SSR/SSG out of the box, making SEO trivial from day one. Avoids painful migrations later. Only use Vite for internal tools where SEO doesn't matter.

## Development
[Fill in: How to run the project locally]

```bash
# Example
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Issue-Based Development

GitHub Issues are the source of truth for all technical work. Use Notion for business/marketing tasks.

### Workflow
1. Check open issues: `gh issue list`
2. Work on an issue: `gh issue view <number>` then implement
3. Reference in commits: `"Fix bug (closes #42)"`
4. Create new issues: `gh issue create` or ask Claude

### Labels

**Type labels:** `feature` `bug` `improvement` `blocked`

**Category labels:** (customize per project, e.g., `setup` `database` `ui` `api` `auth`)

### Issue Templates

Always use the templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` when creating issues:

| Template | Use For | Auto-Label |
|----------|---------|------------|
| `feature.md` | New functionality | `feature` |
| `bug.md` | Something broken | `bug` |
| `improvement.md` | Enhance existing | `improvement` |

**Creating issues via CLI:**
```bash
# Use the template structure in the body
gh issue create --title "Add user auth" --label feature --label auth --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
Add user authentication with email/password.

## User Story
As a user, I want to log in so that my data is saved.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Sign up form
- [ ] Login form
- [ ] Session persistence

## Technical Notes
Use Supabase Auth or NextAuth.js

### Milestones
MVP → v2 → Backlog

### Working on Issues
Use `/issue <number>` to work on a GitHub issue. This command follows a 4-phase workflow:
1. **PLAN** - Understand the issue, search for prior art, document plan in scratchpad
2. **CREATE** - Implement in small steps, commit after each step
3. **TEST** - Run tests, fix failures, verify UI with Chrome extension
4. **DEPLOY** - Final commit with `closes #<number>`, push to main

### Scratchpads
`docs/scratchpads/` stores planning artifacts for issues. These create institutional memory:
- Search here for prior art on similar problems
- Plans are named `issue-{number}-{slug}.md`
- Include implementation steps and link to the issue
